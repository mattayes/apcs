Air Pollution Case Study
====

Here's a dive into the Air Quality System data provided by the EPA. I'm looking at fine particulate matter over the period 1999 – 2012.

Question: Has air quality in the U.S. improved over time?

You can find more information on the data [here](http://aqsdr1.epa.gov/aqsweb/aqstmp/airdata/download_files.html).

* plot1.png: Boxplots of fine particulate pollution in 2009 and 2012. Includes level and log transformations.

* plot2.png: Distribution of readings across the year. Notice how negative readings occur more in certain months.

* plot3.png: Emissions at a particular site in Oregon over time. Both median emissions and variation are down.

* plot4.png: How mean emissions by state have changed over the period. Only a few states are rising.

* script.R: The workhorse that gets all of this done.
